# Week 1 Submission - [Abrham Tesfaye]

## Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.8+ installed
- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] API keys configured

## Completed Exercises
- [x] Simple AI Agent
- [x] Interactive Chat Agent
- [x] Specialized Code Review Agent

## Challenges Faced
- Encountered issues with missing or deprecated Python packages (e.g., `langchain_community`).
- Faced OpenAI API quota errors; learned to check usage and billing.
- Needed to update code to match latest LangChain import paths and error handling.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to set up a Python virtual environment and manage dependencies.
- Gained experience using LangChain to build AI agents with custom prompts.
- Improved skills in debugging Python errors and handling API exceptions.
- Understood the importance of reading deprecation warnings and updating code accordingly.

## Next Steps
- Explore using open-source LLMs as alternatives to OpenAI for local development.
- Experiment with more advanced prompt engineering for specialized domains.
- Integrate user input for interactive agents.
- Learn about deploying AI agents as web applications.

## Summary
- Cleaned up requirements.txt by removing Linux/Ubuntu-specific packages.
- Updated simple_agent.py for better error handling and custom prompts.
- Improved README with learning outcomes and next steps.

## Testing
1. Create a new virtual environment.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the agent script and check for errors.

## Questions
- Are there any dependencies that should still be removed?
- Is the error handling approach appropriate?
- Any suggestions for further improving the agent or documentation?

## Checklist
- [x] Code runs without errors
- [x] Dependencies are Windows-compatible
- [x] Documentation is up to date
